# MapCompose

MapCompose is a fast, memory efficient Jetpack compose library to display tiled maps with minimal effort.
It shows the visible part of a tiled map with support of markers and paths, and various gestures
(flinging, dragging, scaling, and rotating).

An example of setting up:

```kotlin
/* Inside your view-model */
val tileStreamProvider = object : TileStreamProvider {
     override suspend fun getTileStream(row: Int, col: Int, zoomLvl: Int): InputStream? {
         return FileInputStream(File("path/{zoomLvl}/{row}/{col}.jpg")) // or it can be a remote HTTP fetch
     }
}

val state: MapState by mutableStateOf(
    MapState(4, 4096, 4096, tileStreamProvider).apply {
        enableRotation()
        scrollToAndCenter(0.5, 0.5)
    }
)

/* Inside a composable */
@Composable
fun MapContainer(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier, viewModel: YourViewModel
) {
    MapUI(modifier, state = viewModel.state)
}
```

Inspired from [MapView](https://github.com/peterLaurence/MapView), every aspects of the library have
been revisited. MapCompose brings the same level of performance as MapView, with a simplified API.

This project holds the source code of this library, plus a demo app (which is useful to get started).
To test the demo, just clone the repo and launch the demo app from Android Studio Canary (for now).

**ðŸš§ Almost done ðŸš§**

The core library is done, and all features of MapView are now implemented in MapCompose. I'll continue
to add more demo for various scenario.

## Roadmap / TODO

* Core library
  * [x] Implement the equivalent of ZoomPanLayout in compose
  * [x] Implement a first minimal version (tiles loading only)
  * [x] Markers support
  * [x] Paths support
  * [x] Custom drawings support
  * [x] Callouts support

* Demo app
  * [x] Simple map view
  * [x] More advanced rotation APIs use
  * [x] Map with markers
  * [x] Center on marker with animation
  * [x] Map with paths
  * [x] Custom drawings
  * [x] Callouts demo

* Publication
  * [ ] Publish on maven central, under `ovh.plrapps.mapcompose`, artifact id `mapcompose`

## Basics

MapCompose is optimized to display maps that have several levels, like this:

<img src="doc/readme-files/deepzoom.png">
</p>

Each next level is twice bigger than the former, and provides more details. Overall, this looks like
 a pyramid. Another common name is "deep-zoom" map.
This library comes with a demo app made of a set of various use-cases such as using markers,
paths, rotating the map, etc. All examples use the same map stored in the assets. If you wonder what
a deep-zoom maps looks like, you have a great example there.

MapCompose can also be used with single level maps.

### Usage

With Jetpack compose, we have to change the way we think about view state. In the previous `View`
system, we had references on views and mutated their state directly. While that could be done right,
the state often ended-up scattered between views own state and application state. Sometimes, it was
difficult to predict how views were rendered because there were so many things to take into account.

Now, the rendering is function of a state. If that state changes, the "view" updates accordingly.
The library exposes its API though `MapState`, which is the only public handle to mutate the state
of the "view" (or in Compose terms, "composables").
In a typical application, you create a `MapState` instance inside a `ViewModel` (or whatever
component which survives device rotation). Your `MapState` should then be passed to the `MapUI`
composable. The code sample at the top of this readme shows an example.

## Design changes and differences with MapView

* In MapView, you had to define bounds before you could add markers. There's no more such concept
in MapCompose. Now, coordinates are normalized. For example, (x=0.5, y=0.5) is a point located at
the center of the map. Normalized coordinates are easier to reason about, and application code can
still translate this coordinate system to a custom one.

* The `TileStreamProvider` is now an interface with a suspending function:
```kotlin
interface TileStreamProvider {
    suspend fun getTileStream(row: Int, col: Int, zoomLvl: Int): InputStream?
}
```

* In MapView, you had to build a configuration and use that configuration to create a `MapView`
instance. There's no such thing in MapCompose. Now, you create a `MapState` object with required
parameters.

* A lot of things which couldn't change after MapView configuration can now be changed dynamically
in MapCompose. For example, the `zIndex` of a marker, or the minimum scale mode can be changed at
runtime.
